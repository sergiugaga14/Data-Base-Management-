# Data-Base-Management-

# 1.Problem Analysis
A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, 
retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, 
field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data.
Database management systems are set up on specific data handling concepts, as the practice of 
administrating a database evolves. The earliest databases only handled individual single pieces of specially 
formatted data. Todayâ€™s more evolved systems can handle different kinds of less formatted data and tie 
them together in more elaborate ways.

# 2.Modelling

The goal of the project is for the user to be able to manage a data base by inserting, editing, deleting 
and keeping track of elements from three tables: Client, Product and Order. The user has to insert the 
necessary data in some textfields and to press the necessary buttons in order for these operations to be 
completed.

# 5.Conclusions

This assignment offered me a good opportunity to remember and apply the object-oriented 
programming paradigms and concepts. It also offered us an insight into the process of designing and 
developing a software application.
Also, I have never worked using a connection to a database or with reflection techniques before and 
it was a great opportunity to learn new things. I think that it is important that we had to deal with a real life 
situation because that way we can truly understand the applicability of what we learn.
What I will take with me from this experience is not to panic and try to stay calm and divide the 
problem into smaller ones that are easier to deal with, because otherwise the project can be quite 
overwhelming. Another thing is that testing frequently helps you avoid big errors on the long run.
I can say that I am proud that I managed to do this project on my own and that I found solutions for 
all the problems I had through intensive research.
The project is not perfect, it can still be improved, I could add more functionalities to the data base 
management , or design a friendlier and nicer GUI. The methods could also be improved as well as the 
organization and use of the classes.
