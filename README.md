# 1.Problem Analysis
A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, 
retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, 
field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data.
Database management systems are set up on specific data handling concepts, as the practice of 
administrating a database evolves. The earliest databases only handled individual single pieces of specially 
formatted data. Todayâ€™s more evolved systems can handle different kinds of less formatted data and tie 
them together in more elaborate ways.

# 2.Modelling

The goal of the project is for the user to be able to manage a data base by inserting, editing, deleting 
and keeping track of elements from three tables: Client, Product and Order. The user has to insert the 
necessary data in some textfields and to press the necessary buttons in order for these operations to be 
completed.
